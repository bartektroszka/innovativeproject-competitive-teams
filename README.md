The goal of this project was to create a web application that lets users create/join teams and helps them host tournaments or matches between those teams. It allows for easy tournament matchup generation in round-robin, swiss, and single-elimination style tournaments and provides a quick way to keep track of their results.

Main libraries and technologies used in the development of this project:

- Frontend: React, Ant Design, G6, React Router, React Query, Axios, Firebase
- Backend: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, PostgreSQL
- Deployment: Travis CI, Docker, Heroku
